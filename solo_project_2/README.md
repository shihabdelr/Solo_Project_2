Solo Project 1

This project is a simple client-side web application that allows users to manage a collection of soccer teams. Users can view a list of teams, add new teams, edit existing teams, delete teams, and view basic statistics about the collection. All data is stored locally using the browser’s localStorage.
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
